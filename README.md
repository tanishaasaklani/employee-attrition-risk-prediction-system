# 👔 Employee Attrition Risk Prediction System
---
##  Project Overview
Hiring new employees is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project focuses on **HR Analytics** to solve a critical business problem: **predicting who is likely to quit.**

By analyzing employee data (such as age, salary, job role, and work-life balance), this system identifies high-risk employees, allowing HR departments to take proactive retention measures.

## Business Use Case
- **Retention Strategy:** Identify "at-risk" employees before they resign.
- **Cost Reduction:** Reduce the high costs associated with recruiting and training new staff.
- **Workforce Planning:** Understand the root causes of dissatisfaction (e.g., low salary, lack of promotion).

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model:** Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset.
- **Features:** 35 columns (e.g., Age, Department, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, OverTime).
- **Target:** `Attrition` (Yes/No).
